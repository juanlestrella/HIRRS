                    <p>
                        At Head Injury Rehabilitation and Referral Services, Inc. (HIRRS), 
                        we provide people with acquired brain injuries and neurological 
                        disorders with comprehensive, high quality, individualized services 
                        which assist them in achieving their highest potential in their communities.
                        <br><br>
                        All donations to HIRRS are used by the agency, by our clients, in our programs or homes. 
                        <br><br>
                        HIRRS does not sell items to third-parties and we are therefore 
                        only able to accept donations that are new or in excellent condition.
                        <br><br>
                        As a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit agency, donations 
                        to HIRRS are tax deductible to the extent of the law.
